# New Heritage Doll Company: Capital Budgeting

The _New Heritage Doll Company: Capital Budgeting_ case study revolves around a decision-making scenario faced by Emily Harris, the vice president of the production division at New Heritage Doll Company. The case takes place in September 2010, and Harris is tasked with choosing between two promising project proposals for the upcoming capital budgeting meetings. The case is structured to help understand financial analysis, capital budgeting, and strategic decision-making in business settings.

## 1. Overview of New Heritage Doll Company

- Founded in 1985 by Ingrid Beckwith, a retired psychologist who wanted to create dolls that would foster imagination and self-esteem in young girls. The company found success with its line of heirloom dolls, which emphasized wholesome storylines and strong character themes.
- By 2009, the company had grown to 450 employees with revenues of approximately $245 million and an operating profit of $27 million.
- The company was divided into three divisions:
  - **Production**: Designed and produced dolls and accessories.
  - **Retailing**: Focused on intergenerational experiences through online platforms, paper catalogs, and physical stores.
  - **Licensing**: The most profitable division, extending the company’s brand through media and licensing agreements targeting girls aged 3 to 12.

## 2. The Doll Industry

- The toy industry in the U.S. was valued at $42 billion in 2008, with traditional toys and games representing 52% of the market.
- Dolls contributed $3.1 billion to the toy industry in 2008, with growth projected at 3% per year.
- Competition in the doll industry was intense, with few doll lines achieving lasting franchise value. New Heritage Doll Company had managed to establish a solid niche with its heirloom dolls, but like most brands, it faced competition from major players like Barbie.

## 3. Capital Budgeting Process

- New Heritage’s capital budgeting process had a level of informality reflective of its startup origins, although some structure had been introduced as the company grew.
- Large projects were reviewed by a corporate capital budgeting committee, which consisted of senior management. The committee assessed projects based on their alignment with company strategy, financial viability, and division needs.
- Financial forecasts, such as NPV (net present value), IRR (internal rate of return), and payback periods, were key metrics used for project evaluation.

## 4. Project Options

Emily Harris is reviewing two key projects that promise significant growth for the production division. Both projects align with the company’s vision but have financial and strategic challenges.

### a. Match My Doll Clothing Line Expansion

- **Proposal**: Expand the successful "Match My Doll" clothing line, which pairs children’s clothing with matching doll outfits. The expansion would introduce an “All Seasons Collection,” extending the product offering to cover all four seasons of the year.
- **Rationale**: The current clothing line had gained popularity, partly due to high-profile publicity from celebrity children. The expansion is projected to maintain the brand’s premium pricing and potentially smooth out the seasonality of sales.
- **Financials**:
  - Initial outlay: $3.52 million (including R&D, marketing, working capital, and property/equipment).
  - Sales are projected to grow steadily from $4.5 million in 2010 to $14.4 million by 2020.
  - Operating profits begin positive in the second year and increase to $2.2 million by 2020.
- **Risks**: Moderate. The project would rely on extending the existing product line with a proven track record but would need to address seasonality and rapidly changing children’s fashion trends.

### b. Design Your Own Doll Line

- **Proposal**: A new initiative that allows customers to design personalized dolls via a web-based platform. Customers could choose various features for their doll (e.g., hair, skin color, accessories), creating a customized experience.
- **Rationale**: Research showed that girls tend to want dolls that resemble themselves, and this personalization could enhance customer loyalty. This project aligns with New Heritage’s mission of creating unique experiences for consumers.
- **Financials**:
  - Initial outlay: $5.81 million in 2010, with additional working capital and equipment costs in subsequent years.
  - Revenues are projected to grow from $6 million in 2011 to $28.7 million by 2020.
  - Operating profits are expected to be positive from 2012, increasing to $3.7 million by 2020.
- **Risks**: High. This project requires significant upfront investment in software, manufacturing complexity, and technological infrastructure. If the customization platform or manufacturing process encounters problems, it could hurt customer trust.

## 5. Financial Analysis

Each project was evaluated based on:

- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Calculating the present value of future cash flows to determine the project’s profitability.
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: The discount rate at which the project’s NPV becomes zero.
- **Payback Period**: The time required to recover the initial investment.

Both projects have the potential to be profitable, but they differ in terms of financial metrics, risk, and strategic impact:

- The _Match My Doll Clothing Line Expansion_ has a lower investment requirement and a more predictable revenue stream since it builds on an existing product line.
- The _Design Your Own Doll_ line has the potential for much higher revenues but requires greater upfront investment and comes with higher risks due to the reliance on new technology and untested processes.

## 6. Decision Criteria

- **Strategic Fit**: How well does the project align with New Heritage’s overall strategy of offering innovative, imaginative doll products?
- **Financial Viability**: Which project offers the best return on investment with the least risk?
- **Resource Allocation**: Given the company’s constraints, which project makes the best use of financial and managerial resources?
- **Market Potential**: Which project has the best chance of capturing market share and sustaining growth?

## 7. Emily Harris’s Decision

Harris must choose which project to recommend for approval at the upcoming capital budgeting meeting. Each project has strong potential, but New Heritage’s limited resources mean that it’s unlikely both projects will be approved. Harris’s recommendation will need to be supported by solid financial analysis and a clear understanding of each project’s risks and strategic implications.

## 8. Takeaways

- **Capital Budgeting**: The case illustrates the importance of capital budgeting in ensuring that limited resources are allocated to the projects that will generate the most value for a company.
- **Risk and Reward**: The decision involves balancing risk with potential reward, especially when dealing with innovative products and new technologies.
- **Strategic Alignment**: Business decisions are not just about financial returns but also about how well a project fits into the company’s broader strategy and mission.
